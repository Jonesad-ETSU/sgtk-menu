# sway-gtk-menu
This project is an attempt to create a **simple** menu, that behaves decently on sway window manager.

Well, I didn't even think sway needed a menu, as I'm really happy with [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi) and/or 
[dmenu-wayland](https://github.com/nyyManni/dmenu-wayland). I started coding just to learn what the freedesktop 
[Desktop Menu Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/menu-spec/latest) looks like, and also learn some 
more [pygobject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest).

[The best menu I know](https://github.com/johanmalm/jgmenu), however, does not (yet?) behave well on sway. So, I thought
to share the code, which already took me more time that I had ever expected.

Many thanks to [Johan Malm](https://github.com/johanmalm) for the ideas that I have looked at in 
[his code](https://github.com/johanmalm/jgmenu/blob/master/contrib/pmenu/jgmenu-pmenu.py).
